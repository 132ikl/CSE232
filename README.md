## Announcements

Posted: 1/10/20

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to CSE232! ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>Please go through <a href="Labs/lab00.md">Lab 00</a> to get started with the course. It'll have you set up Mimir, Visual Studio Code, and a C++ compiler. We expect that you'll have all of these resources available by your first class meeting.</p>
<p>â€” Braedyn Lettinga</p>
</blockquote>

## Course Schedule

It should be assumed that all assignments are due by 10:00 PM EST on their respective due dates. Due dates are subject to change, but if a change is made, an announcement will be made on Piazza.

Links to lecture videos, projects, and other materials will be made available as relevant dates approach. Content that is written for future weeks may change without notice until the date arrives.

You can hover over a calendar cell to see its precise date (sorry mobile users).
