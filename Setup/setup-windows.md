# Using C++ in VSCode - Windows

The following tutorial assumes you are running on Windows 10.

If you encounter any trouble during this tutorial, please ask about your problem on Piazza, or come to Help Room.

## Getting a Compiler

Despite many of the Windows applications being written in C, Microsoft does not package a C/C++ compiler with the operating system. So, we unfortunately have to install one ourselves.

We recommend that you install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), a software package that includes the compiler we'll be using, GCC.
