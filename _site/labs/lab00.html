<h2 id="writing-in-c">Writing in C++</h2>

<p>For this class, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (or VSCode). <strong>You are free to use other code editors, but, you are responsible for knowing how to work with it</strong>.</p>

<p>We have thoroughly-documented tutorials on how to setup a C++ VSCode environment, with an active debugger as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../setup/setup-windows.html">Windows Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="../setup/setup-macos.html">MacOS Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="../setup/setup-linux.html">Linux Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please come back to this page when you have VSCode ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="code-editors">Code Editors</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is a modern programmer’s editor. It is very flexible, has many options, and can be used cross-platform. If you want to be a programmer, this is a good one to learn.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> is another, very modern code editor that’s exclusive to MacOS. I’ve not used it myself, but I’ve heard great things about it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is a very old, very configurable, editor. The joke is that emacs is an operating system disguised as an editor.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gedit.en.softonic.com/">gedit</a> is a straightforward editor. It is not very configurable but does a good job at just being an editor. If all else fails, I would pick gedit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim</a> is also very old, but comes as standard in many Linux operating systems as a default editor. I wouldn’t start here, but learning the basics of Vim is something every programmer should do.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-with-c">Working with C++</h2>

<h3 id="about-c">About C++</h3>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Languages come in various “levels”, from “low” (meaning very close to the CPU they might run on) to “high” (meaning very far from the CPU they might run on). Python is a great example of a high-level language. C++ is like an intermediate language; it doesn’t give you all the help you might recieve from Python, but it gives you much more help than, say, Assembly.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that C++ is a compiled language. That means that you must pass your code through another piece of software, called a <strong>compiler</strong>, that translates your C++ into (nearly) machine-ready code. Note that Python has no requirement, as there is always an <strong>interpreter</strong> available for running Python code.</p>

<p>The greatest strength of C++ is its potential for creating fast executables and robust libraries. A programmer can control low-level aspects of how data is stored, how information is passed, and how memory is managed. When used wisely, this control can lead to a more streamlined result – this is the point of the class. You are in charge of how your code runs because you, the programmer, are responsible for most aspects of how your code runs. This is a double-edged sword, as being responsible gives you more opportunities to screw up.</p>

<p>One of the problems with C++ is that parts of the syntax have grown cryptic. There may be <em>many</em> ways of expressing the same thing. An experienced and knowledgeable developer can use this flexibility to pick the best alternative and improve the result. Yet, both novice and experienced programmers can easily choose the wrong alternative, leading to less-efficient, and possibly flawed, software. Be careful!</p>

<h3 id="compiler-differences">Compiler Differences</h3>

<p>The VSCode installation tutorials above are split by operating system for one fundamental reason: MacOS users will be compiling their code with Clang, and Windows users will be compiling their code with GCC. C++ compilers are just like any other program – depending on versions and vendors, compilers can have differing behavior. Thus, we have a “Rule of Compiling” for this class…</p>

<p><strong>The Rule of Compiling</strong>: no matter how you develop your code, the only compiler that matters is the one on Mimir, i.e., the one that will be testing your code. If it compiles and runs there, great. If not, then it is up to you to get it to compile there.</p>

<h2 id="editing-and-compiling-c">Editing and Compiling C++</h2>

<p>The first program you run in any new language is the “Hello world” program. This program does nothing but print the statement “Hello world”. It is a tradition because it does little except focus on the mechanics of writing your first program and running it. You can look at the wikibooks <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Programming/Hello_world">Hello world</a> page for more than 200 language interpretations.</p>

<p>In C++, Hello world is fairly easy, but clearly more work than in Python!</p>

<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s">"Hello world"</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">endl</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Write or copy-paste this code into a file named “lab00.cpp” to follow along.</p>

<p>To compile our Hello world program, type the following into terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">g++ lab00.cpp -std=c++17 -Wall
</code></pre>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g++</code> is the GNU C++ compiler. In the above line, we have added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-std=c++17</code> flag to ensure that the code is compiled using the newer C++17 standard (by default, most C++ compilers use the C++98 standard, which does not include all of the features/extensions that we will be using in this class).
Although our Hello world program does not contain any C++17 extensions, it is a good idea to get into the habit of including this flag. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Wall</code> flag is useful for finding errors, it’s an abbreviation for “warnings, all”.</p>

<p>By default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g++</code> will create an executable named <strong>a.out</strong> (or <strong>a.exe</strong>, depending on the compiler). If your compilation was successful, you should see this newly created file in your current directory.</p>

<p>To execute/run the program, type:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a.out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or, if you have an a.exe file:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a.exe
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all has gone according to plan, running the program should result in “Hello world” being printed to the command line.</p>

<p>⭐ These star emojis are checkpoints where you should stop and check in with your lab TA. If you are in an in-person lab, this would mean raising your hand and having the TA look over your work. If you are in a virtual Zoom lab, you should now click the “Request Assistance” button from your breakout room to summon your TA.</p>

<p>The typical workflow is something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edit your code using your favorite editor, then save it (ensuring that the file has a “.cpp” suffix).</li>
  <li>In your terminal, enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g++ {your file's name}.cpp -std=c++17 -Wall</code>.</li>
  <li>If there are errors (and there <em>will</em> be errors), read the messages and edit your code. Repeat until it compiles.</li>
  <li>Once your code compiles, enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a.out</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a.exe</code> into the terminal to run the compiled executable, and observe the (hopefully correct) output for testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>You repeat this process of edit-compile-run until you get the desired result.</p>

<h2 id="mimir">Mimir</h2>

<p>For some labs, and <strong>all projects</strong>, we will be using Mimir. Mimir provides a convienent way to write, test, and submit code. Most assignments will have an associated Mimir page like this one. Follow the directions below to submit your Lab 00 assignment for automatic grading.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-mimir">Accessing Mimir</h3>

<p>Joining Mimir is <strong>required</strong> for this course. You have to join since it is the only way you can turn in your work. In the long run, I think you will appreciate having the ability to test your code before turning it in.</p>

<p>You should have already recieved an invitation to Mimir for this class. If you have not yet received it, <strong>please inform your TA</strong>.</p>

<p>In the Live Coursework section, find and click the link to the Lab 00 assignment (obviously we aren’t in Spring 2018, but you get the idea):</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/images/mimir_start.png" />
</div>

<p>Once you’ve clicked the assignment, you’ll be brought to the assignment’s Submission page. On that page, you’ll have the project’s description, and a link to upload your assignment.</p>

<p>At the top-right are three important buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Submit</strong> - this is the button you’ll want to use to upload your code</li>
  <li><strong>Download Starter Code</strong> - this gives you a .zip file of the code we want you to edit</li>
  <li><strong>Open IDE</strong> - this opens Mimir’s terminal and editor</li>
</ul>

<p>Click the “Open IDE” button to go to Mimir’s IDE. It should open a separate tab that looks like this:</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/images/mimir_ide_start.png" />
</div>

<h3 id="the-unix-terminal">The Unix Terminal</h3>

<p>In future labs, there will be short sections dedicated to learning more about the terminal. Windows users pretty much <em>have</em> to follow with the Mimir IDE in this circumstance, where MacOS/Linux users can follow along using their local terminal if they so choose.</p>

<p>The Mimir IDE can also be used to write C/C++ code. We’ll be coding here today just so there’s a bit of exposure to the Mimir IDE interface, and in case some students were unable to get a local code editor running on their machines.</p>

<h2 id="coding-assignment">Coding Assignment</h2>

<p>Lab 00 consists of two (hopefully simple) tasks. Correcting a typo in the file “hello_world.cpp” and creating a new file called “academic_dishonesty.cpp”.</p>

<h3 id="hello_worldcpp">hello_world.cpp</h3>

<p>I tried to write a “hello_world.cpp” file to show you how easy it is, but I made a typo. Take a look at the “hello_world.cpp” file. It should already be open, but it is located in a folder with the class’ name -&gt; lab00__hello_world -&gt; lab00.</p>

<p>Please correct my spelling of “Hello”, then save the file.</p>

<p>Right-click on the <strong>parent</strong> of the folder named “lab00”, and select “Submit folder contents”. Be sure to select the correct assignment as well.</p>

<p>Now you can go to your submissions page (the other Mimir tab), and confirm that you are passing the tests regarding hello_world.cpp.</p>

<h3 id="academic_dishonestycpp">academic_dishonesty.cpp</h3>

<p>The next part of the assignment involves making a new file called “academic_dishonesty.cpp”.</p>

<p>Right-click on the folder named “lab00” and create a new file named “academic_dishonesty.cpp”. Make sure the name is <em>exactly</em> what is indicated.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: you may need to right-click on the folder tree and select “refresh” for your newly created file to exist.</p>

<p>Copy the contents of hello_world.cpp into this new file.</p>

<p>Submit the assignment again like we did before. You should pass all but the last test – we’ll need to fix that.</p>

<p>Modify academic_dishonesty.cpp to print out the following message <em>exactly</em> (instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Hello world"</code>):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"My name is Josh Nahum. I read the syllabus and I understand the consequences of academic dishonesty."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file needs to have the exact message above, but the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Josh Nahum</code> should be changed to have <em>your</em> name instead (using only alphabetical characters and spaces). By submitting this assignment, you are confirming that you read the <a href="../SYLLABUS.md">syllabus</a> and understand the consequences of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Submit the assignment – you should pass all of the tests. Congratulations!</p>

<p>⭐ Demonstrate to your TA that you are passing all of the tests.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-on-labs">Collaboration on Labs</h2>

<p>Everyone should be in pairs (or trios) for future labs. Pair programming is a common and productive method of software developement used in the industry. It is also very useful in educational settings.</p>

<p>Traditionally, there are two roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Driver” - this role is the only one allowed to touch the mouse and keyboard. They do all of the coding.</li>
  <li>“Navigator” - this role is tasked with looking over the code that was written, suggesting edits/fixes, looks for bugs, and so on. Generally, they are in charge of the “big picture” stuff, how code should be structured, coming up with names and algorithms, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in a trio, I recommend having the Navigator role be broken into the “Observer” (who actively watches and comments on what the Driver is doing) and the “Guide” (who keeps open useful documents and plans out the pseudocode for future parts).</p>

<p>Depending on how your TA is managing the lab, these roles will often be swapped periodically (at the TA’s call) to ensure everyone participates in both roles equally.</p>

<p>There are many ways to collaborate even if you are working together virtually. The simplest is to have the Driver share their screen and have the other roles watch and comment verbally as needed. When a different driver is needed, the current code can be shared in the Zoom chat (via file upload) with the new driver. Alternatively, if you are using VSCode as your editor, the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/">Live Share extension</a> allows you to invite others to join your editor session (like Google Docs).</p>

<p>In future labs, you will be compelled to work with a partner. So, I recommend figuring out who you are comfortable with right now.</p>
