# Lab - Code Review

## Ask Me Anything - TA Edition

Before you get assigned to work in your paired programming. Please use the biggining of this lab to ask you TA about concepts that you have been having a hard time grasping. You can ask about recent topics (like converting constructors) or older concepts like what it means to put ```cin >> str``` in a while loops conditional clause. And I'm sure some of you are still uncomfortable with pointers, references, and const.

Now is the time to ask questions and hear from your TA. You are also welcome to ask about your TAs background and interests. Many of them have even taken this course some time ago. They all have useful insights on future CSE courses you may be considering.


## Pair Code Review

Next your TA should walk you through some example solutions to an assignment, noting features of well-written and not-so-well-written examples of solving a recent assignment (likely Project 2). Please use this opprotunity to learn about what habits you have theat you may need to correct. Writing code is challenging, and writing code that is easy for others to understand is harder still. Please don't take criticism as an attack on your person, but as an opprotunity to learn.

Lastly, you'll be broken up into pairs / small groups to review each others' solutions to a recent assignment. In order to recieve credit for the lab, you'll need to explain to the TA some specific ways your solution could have been written better (e.g. more legible, more clear, more correct). You can even demonstrate the improved solution for compare-and-contrast if time is permitting.

‚≠ê Show the TA your the improvements suggested by your peers.
