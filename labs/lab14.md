# Lab - Last Lab

There is no Unix tutorial nor coding assignment this week.

Instead you will be using this lab to review for the final exam and evaluate your TA.

We strongly recommend coming to this lab with questions. Questions on the lectures, the labs, the homework assignments, the projects, the midterm, and the sample final. Use this opprotunity to get your TA to explain any aspect of the course that hasn't quite connected yet.

Additionally, we ask that you complete this anonymous TA evaluation form. The course as a whole will be evaluated by Online SIS at the university level, but that platform doesn't support TA feedback. After the grades are submitted, your anonymous feedback will be given to your TAs and they will have the opprotunity to improve their craft in response to your (hopefully) constructive criticism.

Although we recommend attending a synchronous lab to get the best opprotunity for exam preparation, if you open and answer at least one question in the sample final exam assignment before the final exam review session on Friday, we will give you credit for the lab.
