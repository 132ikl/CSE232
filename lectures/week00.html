<p>Synchronous labs begin next week (the second week of the semester). Please check your schedule and show up for your scheduled lab. All Section 730 students will be assigned a synchronous lab to attend, see details on Piazza. Each week will have videos, example code, and relevant notes. You are expected to be caught up with the material and to have read (but not solved) each lab before attending your Zoom session. To help faciliate this, certain homeworks may have labeled questions that require reading the next week's lab content.</p>
