# Setup

We recommend that you use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for this course. You are free to use other code editors, but you are responsible for knowing how to work with it. We supply tutorials on the installation process here (dependent on your operating system):
- [Windows](setup/setup-windows.html)
- [MacOS](setup/setup-macos.html)
- [Linux](setup/setup-linux.html)

This tutorial is meant to be completed alongside [Lab 01](labs/lab01.html). Please go through the lab if you haven't already.

**Windows users**: if you encounter an avalanche of trouble with the above tutorial, try installing the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) instead. This also gives you access to local Unix commands, which will be taught in future labs.

Never learned how to use an IDE debugger? We have you covered! [You can find a guide here](debugging_guide.html).
