# Using C++ in VSCode - Windows

In this tutorial, we'll be installing Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This is a somewhat complex thing to get installed, and so it's imperative that you read through these instructions carefully.

To begin, we'll first talk about what WSL is, and why we recommend it. I'll talk about an alternative as well, but the alternative should only be used if you, for whatever reason, cannot get WSL installed properly, or something goes wrong with your WSL installation at some point during the semester.

### What is WSL?

The Windows Subsystem for Linux creates a fully-functional Linux filesystem directly onto your Windows machine. It gives you complete access to Linux command-line tools, which you'll be learning about in this class' labs.

### Why WSL?

Windows does not come equipped with Linux command-line tools. It provides two shells: Command Prompt and Windows Powershell, both of which do not provide the same set of tools as those that you'd have on a Unix-like system (Windows Powershell has some of them, but not all that we'll be talking about in this course).

It's possible to compile and run C++ programs without a Unix-like system through software like [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), but you will ultimately need a Unix shell to access the other commands that we'll be learning about.

### What if I can't install WSL?

There is a browser-based IDE called [Replit](https://replit.com/~) that I recommend if you cannot get WSL working on your machine. The reason we don't recommend using it for the course outright is due to speed; we'll be creating larger and larger programs as the semester goes on, and eventually you'll notice how slow Replit gets as the size of your programs increases. WSL is not bound to a browser, and thus has access to more of your computer's hardware. 

Other than that, Replit is an easy-to-use and quickly accessible way to start writing, compiling, and testing code. You get access to Linux command-line tools, a simple debugger, and Google Doc-like collaboration features.

### Uninstalling WSL

At the end of this course, you may want to remove the subsystem. In doing so, keep in mind that you'll lose access to Linux command-line tools (`ssh` being a big one that you may encounter in later courses). If you are confident in your choice to remove the subsystem, copy your CSE 232 files over to the Windows side if you want to keep them, and follow the instructions below.

Open a Windows Powershell instance and run the command:

```bash
wsl --unregister Ubuntu-20.04
```

Then uninstall Ubuntu (and Windows Terminal, if you installed it) from the "Apps & Features" menu in your Windows settings.

If you had installed a different distribution, replace `Ubuntu-20.04` with the name of your distribution (a list of the distributions you have installed can be found using the command `wsl -l`).

## Requirements

You must be running Windows 10 build 19041 or higher, or any build of Windows 11 to proceed.

To check your Windows 10 build, use the key combination: Windows Key + R to pull up a small quick-run window, type **winver** into the box that appears, and hit ENTER. This should bring up a new window that shows information about your Windows installation. Check to make sure your build number is greater than or equal to 19041.

If you have a build number less than 19041, take the time now to update your system in the Windows settings. This can take a while; note that more updates may appear after installing ones that are already present in the settings menu.

## Getting Linux Command-Line Tools and a Compiler

Search "Windows Powershell" in the Windows search bar, find the Windows Powershell application, and right-click it to **Run as administrator**. Then, execute this command in the shell:

```bash
wsl --install
```

This command will make some configurations and install the latest version of the Linux distribution, Ubuntu, for you (version 20.04 at the time of writing; if you're familiar with, and want another distribution, [you can find a list of available ones here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed)).

After running this command, restart your computer if the command didn't already restart it for you.

After restarting, a new console may appear asking for you to set up a username and password for the Linux distribution. If this new console didn't appear, you can open your Linux distribution console like any other app (you can search "Ubuntu" in the Windows search bar and it should appear; use the name of the distribution you installed if you changed it from the default).

<div align="center">

</div>

Go ahead and make a username and password. _Note that, when typing out your password, the characters you're typing will be hidden from you. Type carefully!_ Most command-line tools that ask for passwords will do this.

You should now have your Linux distribution ready-to-go! Here is what my console looks like after setting a username and password:

<div align="center">
<img src="../assets/images/vscode_installation_windows/2.png">
</div>

This thing here: `braedynl@DESKTOP-5N5A75I:~$` is the prompt. Mine will be slightly different from yours; the format it follows is roughly:

```
{Your username}@{Your computer's name}:{Your current working directory}$
```

By default, opening the distribution console will place you in your "home directory" (represented by the tilde symbol, `~`). The actual path of your home directory is

```
/home/{Your username}
```

Which you can see by using the command `pwd`.

Let's now install our compiler. This can be done simply by executing the command:

```bash
sudo apt install g++
```

This will ask you for the password you setup earlier. Again, bear in mind that the characters you type for the password prompt will be hidden from you.

Your terminal will populate with _a lot_ of junk after this. You'll be asked if you want to continue; type `Y` and hit ENTER to confirm.

Your terminal will look something like this by the end of the installation:

</div>

We now have access to Linux command-line tools and a C++ compiler. We're not done yet, though. Let's now get Visual Studio Code installed and working with WSL.

I recommend keeping this instance of your Linux terminal open for the next series of steps.

## Preparing VSCode for C++

**Important**: when prompted to "Select Additional Tasks" during this first installation, be sure that the "**Add to PATH**" option is checked **on** (it should already be checked on):

[Download and install the Stable version of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Open VSCode and click on the icon of four squares to the left sidebar. This will open the VSCode Extensions Marketplace. Search for "remote development", and the first result should be an extension of the same name, made by Microsoft.

<div align="center">
<img src="../assets/images/vscode_installation_windows/5.png">
</div>

Go ahead and hit the top **Install** button.

Close out of the VSCode instance you were just using to install the Remote Development extension, and bring up your Linux terminal. Stay or navigate to the home directory (execute `cd ~` if you're not there).

Run the command: `code .` (note the space-separated period following the word "code"), and you should see the terminal unpack some items and launch a new VSCode instance. This unpacking is a one-time thing; it will normally open a VSCode window instantaneously.

</div>

<div align="center">

</div>

You should now see these files when opening the integrated explorer, with the integrated terminal showing your Linux distribution prompt (for Ubuntu, the shell that is being ran is called "bash"). If the integrated terminal didn't appear, use the key combination CTRL + ` (this is the backtick character, left of the **1** key on most keyboards) to toggle the terminal.

Once again navigate to the Extensions Marketplace, and now search for "C/C++". You should, again, find an extension of the same name developed by Microsoft.

<div align="center">
<img src="../assets/images/vscode_installation_windows/8.png">
</div>

Hit the **Install in WSL: Ubuntu-20.04** button once you're there. Note that we're _not_ installing the "C/C++ Extension Pack". It comes with a lot of extra stuff that we will not be using in this course.

Once the extension has been installed, navigate back to the integrated file explorer (the top icon, the files stacked onto one another), and right-click the panel in an open space. You'll find that you have many of the options you'd normally have in File Explorer:

<div align="center">
<img src="../assets/images/vscode_installation_windows/9.png">
</div>

Create a new file called "helloworld.cpp", and type/copy-paste the following code into it:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;
}
```

The terminal is where you compile your C++ source code. Most labs will have short sections dedicated to learning more about the terminal, as you'll need to be comfortable with it for future classes. Save your helloworld.cpp file if you haven't already (CTRL + S), and in order to compile our lovely program, type the following command into the terminal:

```bash
g++ helloworld.cpp -Wall -std=c++17
```

This produces a file named "a.out" â€“ you should see it appear in the file explorer. To run your compiled program, type into the terminal:

```bash
./a.out
```

And you should then see "Hello world" displayed to the console!

<div align="center">
<img src="../assets/images/vscode_installation_windows/10.png">
</div>

<div align="center">
<p>Congratulations! You just made your first program in C++.</p>
</div>

It's important to note that **you must compile your program and run a.out every time you want to test your code**. You will be typing those two commands hundreds of times in this course. Keep them in your notes or memorize them (you'll likely have them memorized within a few days of practice).

## Debugging C++ in VSCode

You should be familiar with an IDE debugger from your previous programming class (CSE 231 or an equivalent prerequisite). [If you aren't, please read through this tutorial](../debugging_guide.html) (it's in Python, but the same core principles apply).

Like we did to install our compiler, `g++`, we need to install a debugger. Type the following command into the terminal (the one in VSCode or a separate Linux terminal window, both are the same):

```bash
sudo apt install gdb
```
